# Servie

## Description

A minimalistic web server built using C. It's purpose is to improve my web programming skills by understanding how the HTTP protocol works 
on a lower level then what I am used to (.NET and React).

## Goal

My main goal for the project is to evnetually transform it to a minimalistic, light-weight web framework of mine which I can use
at a later stage either in embedded systems or in general. I am also planning as I better my understanding of the low-level parts
of the proccess to introduce some sort of my own version of server-side rendering process.
